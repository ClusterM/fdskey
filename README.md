## Flashing the firmware
There are five TH pads (actually 6 but 1 is unused) on the PCB to connect a ST-Link programmer (GND, VCC, SWD, SWCLK and NRST). First, you need to write the bootloader - **bootloader.bin** file. Then you can put the main firmware file - **fdskey.bin** on your SD card (FAT/FAT32/exFAT formatted) and hold all four buttons on power-on, e.g. connect FDSKey to RAM adaptor, hold buttons and turn a Famicom on. You can use the same method to update the main firmware in the future without additional hardware.

After the first boot, press and hold the **left** button on the main menu screen for 3 seconds to access the service menu. There, you can select the OLED display controller type (change it if the display shows a corrupted image) and check some system information.

## Device usage
Format a microSD card to FAT/FAT32/exFAT and put some .fds files on it. Insert a microSD card into a FDSKey, insert a FDSKey into a RAM Adaptor's cable instead of a physical disk drive and turn on a Famicom. You can hot plug a FDSKey when Famicom is already on too, it's ok.

Now you can navigate through the FDSKey interface using the buttons. **Left** button usually means **back**, **right** button usually means **OK** and **up**/**down** are used to select something (file, disk side, etc.) Also, you can long press the **left** button in the file browser to directly return to the main menu from a subfolder, and long press the **right** button to open the file properties menu.

![FDSKey - interface flowchart](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4236181/232327286-8afaa7cd-3d97-4b34-bb7b-d6d20e7622c6.png)

Oops, too complicated :( Let's try again...

![GUI](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4236181/233791612-959ba4ce-804c-4253-aff5-36fda6b2c8e1.png)

Much better.

**WARNING**: when a game writes some data to a virtual disk (i.e., saves game progress) don't turn off your Famicom power until the updated ROM has been saved to the SD card. Wait a second for it or eject a virtual disk (**left** button). A **saving** message will be displayed, do not turn off power while this message is visible.

### Settings menu
Use **up**/**down** buttons to select a setting and **left**/**right** to change it. Setting descriptions:
* **Rewind speed**: you can select a drive operation speed as either **original** (very slow, like on a physical FDS drive, for the nostalgic ones), **fast** (where the rewind time is reduced but the virtual head position is not altered), or **turbo** (the fastest possible mode, instant head rewind).
* **Remember state**: you can select a power-on state between **none** (always start from the main menu), **browser** (open browser and select last file if browser was opened before power off), and **ROM** (start first side of the last started game emulation if ROM emulation was active before power off).
* **Saves** (since v1.1): you can select how to save game progress as either **overwrite** (just overwrite the original .fds file), **backup+overwrite** (just overwrite the original .fds file but make backup to .fds.bak file first), or **like EverDrive** (EverDrive-compatible saves format).
* **Hide non .fds files**: hide files with non .fds extension in the file browser.
* **Hide .fds extensions**: hide .fds extension in the file browser.
* **Hide hidden files**: hide hidden files and directories in the file browser.
* **Brightness**: screen brightness from 0 to 10.
* **Invert screen**: draw black on white instead of white on black.
* **Lefty mode**: rotate screen image on 180 degrees and flip buttons.
* **Screen off after**: time before automatic screen off if there is no any action (button presses, drive activity), it's recommended to use this feature to prevent OLED screen burn-in.
* **[ Save and return ]**: press **left** or **right** button on this item to return to the main menu.

### Service menu ###
You can access the service menu by holding the **left** button on the main menu screen for 3 seconds. This menu is mainly meant for developers or advanced users. There is a lot of system information and several options/functions:
* **OLED controller**: try to change it in case if "lefty mode" is not working correctly.
* **[ Format SD card ]**: use it if you want to make low-level format of your SD card. Use it with caution as you will lose all your data! Make sure to backup your data first.
* **[ Update bootloader ]**: update bootloader firmware. You need to put both **bootloader.bin** and **bootloader.bin.md5** files in the root of your SD card. Use it with caution! In case of failure (power loss during update) you will brick the device.
* **[ Save and return ]**: press **left** or **right** button on this item to return to the main menu.

### How to dump physical disks
You can use a homebrew disk copier applications to copy a physical disk to a virtual one, simply create an empty ROM. There is **Create blank disk** item in the main menu for it.
1. Put **Disk Hacker**/**Disk Keeper** or another homebrew disk copier ROM on SD card.
2. Select a disk copier software on your SD card like any other ROM and load it.
3. Return to the main menu and select **Create blank disk**.
4. Enter filename for the new ROM, trailing spaces will be trimmed.
5. When disk copier asks to insert game disk disconnect a FDSKey from a RAM adaptor and connect a physical FDS drive with a game disk inserted.
6. When disk copier asks to insert new/blank disk disconnect a physical drive, connect a FDSKey and select ROM created in steps 3-4.
7. Repeat steps 5-6 until the copy operation is completed.

### How to write physical disks
This is a reverse operation of dumping: you can use disk copiers homebrew applications to copy a virtual disk to a physical one.
1. Put **Disk Hacker**/**Disk Keeper** or another homebrew disk copier ROM on SD card.
2. Select a disk copier software on your SD card like any other ROM and load it.
3. When disk copier asks to insert game disk select the source ROM/side.
4. When disk copier asks to insert new/blank disk disconnect a FDSKey from a RAM adaptor and connect a physical FDS drive with blank disk inserted.
5. Disconnect a physical FDS drive and connect FDSKey.
6. Repeat steps 3, 4, and 5 until the copy operation is completed.

## Firmware updates
You can always download the latest version at https://github.com/ClusterM/fdskey/releases.

Also, you can download automatic interim builds at http://clusterm.github.io/fdskey/.

Remember, you can update the firmware by putting **fdskey.bin** on your SD card and holding all four buttons on power-on.
